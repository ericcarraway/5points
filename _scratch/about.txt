Past

Founded in 2011, Capital City Percussion began as a place for young percussionists in central Ohio to grow as musicians and performers. Cap City began competing in the Winter Guard International circuit during the 2012 season, finishing in 9th place in open class at the WGI World Championships. The group took home open class gold in 2013, and moved to world class for the 2014 and 2015 seasons.


Present

Capital City Percussion is a non-profit youth organization dedicated to achieving excellence in the performing arts. We compete in the Ohio Indoor Performance Association and Winter Guard International circuits during the winter and spring months as a world class ensemble. Our members and staff are all extremely passionate about the activity, and spend countless hours perfecting our art.


Future

As Capital City Percussion enters its 5th season of competition, we look forward to the challenges and opportunities that will present themselves along the road to WGI World Championships. Our organization is driven to work harder than ever before, and we hope this will be reflected in the production we put on for fans cheering us on from the stands and at home. We're proud of the talent in central Ohio, and want to show the world!
