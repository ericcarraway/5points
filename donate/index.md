### We Need Your Help!

Operating an independent percussion ensemble is not cheap.&nbsp; We do our best to keep membership costs to a minimum,
and therefore must find other ways to raise money for expenses such as equipment, travel, rehearsal space,
and competition fees.&nbsp; Any and all donations go directly towards offsetting these costs.

Every little bit helps, and thank you for your support!
